# AdaSwarm

This repo implements AdaSwarm, an optimizer, that combines Gradiant Descent and Particile Swarms. 
It is to appear as "AdaSwarm: Augmenting Gradient-Based optimizers in Deep Learning with Swarm Intelligence, _Rohan Mohapatra, Snehanshu Saha, Carlos A. Coello Coello, Anwesh Bhattacharya Soma S. Dhavala, and Sriparna Saha_", in IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence.
